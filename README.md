# ServiceMesh

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a Service Mesh using Istio, aimed at providing comprehensive service-to-service communication management, traffic control, security, and observability within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Background

As microservice architecture gains popularity, managing inter-service communication becomes increasingly complex. Service Mesh, particularly Istio, offers a robust solution to manage these communications at the infrastructure level, providing enhanced traffic management, security, and observability.

## Features

- **Traffic Management**: Service discovery, load balancing, traffic splitting, fault injection, and more.
- **Security**: Mutual TLS, authentication, and authorization between services.
- **Observability**: Metrics, logs, and tracing for monitoring and analyzing service communications.
- **Policy Management**: Configuration and management of traffic control and security policies.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:

- **Istio Control Plane**: Manages and configures the Envoy proxies deployed in the data plane.
- **Istio Data Plane**: Envoy proxies that handle service-to-service communication.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform to deploy and manage microservices.
- **Observability Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Kiali for monitoring, logging, and tracing.
